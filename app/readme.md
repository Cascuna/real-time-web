## Purpose of the app
This will be a real-time chat application. As a baseline the [socketio](https://socket.io/demos/chat/) chat demo will be taken, but  

## Style of the project
For the general codestyle I decided to adhere to the [google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html). This is because it's fairly new and is a bit different then my current coding style, which is mostly based of the airbnb styleguide. With this i hope to be able to slowly form my own coding style.
As for the document structure I decided to use [risingstacks](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-hero-node-js-project-structure-tutorial/) project structure as a baseline.   
Reasoning behind this is that I personally find the MVC document structure most sources recommend quite cluttered, and I prefer to create my app parts as encapsulated as possible.  Down the line i'll probably divert from risingstacks structure slightly, and will document my adaptations here.
